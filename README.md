# Running The Project Locally
1. Clone the project (```git clone https://github.com/jeffersonly/Aloompa.git```)
2. Go into the main directory and run ```npm install``` (this installs concurrently so we can easily install/run the proj)
3. After the dependencies are installed, run ```npm run install-all``` (this will install all the dependencies for the frontend and backend)
4. Once the installations are finished, run ```npm run run-all-dev``` (this will start the frontend and backend as well as the json server)
